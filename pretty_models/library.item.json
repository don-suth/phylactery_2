Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.\r\n\r\nThe year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. \"Salem\" takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.\r\n\r\nThe game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.\r\n\r\nPlayers can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.\r\n\r\nPlayers, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, \"Witch\" or \"Not a Witch.\"\r\n\r\nDuring gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all \"Witch\" Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.\r\n\r\nPlayers can also use green and blue cards such as \"Alibi\", \"Stocks\", \"Matchmaker\", \"Asylum\", and \"Scapegoat\" to help or hurt their allies or enemies.\r\n\r\nAs players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, \"Night\", forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, \"Conspiracy,\" forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise \"Conspiracy\" may soon have the whole town turned evil.\r\n\r\nBefore long, accusations will be flying, and screams of \"She's a WITCH!\" will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.",

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you\u2019ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven\u2019t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\r\n\r\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\r\n\r\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\r\n\r\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.",

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.\r\n\r\nDead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!\r\n\r\nDead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.\r\n\r\nDead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves.

Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.\r\n\r\nThe islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\r\n\r\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.\r\n\r\nAt game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\r\n\r\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony).

      "description": "In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total.\r\n\r\nA player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards \u2013 i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:\r\n\r\n- Income: Take one coin from the treasury.\r\n- Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)\r\n\r\nWhen you take one of the character actions \u2013 whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action \u2013 that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\r\n\r\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\r\n\r\nThe last player to still have influence \u2013 that is, a face-down character \u2013 wins the game!\r\n\r\nCoup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game.

      "description": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\r\n\r\nSetup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\r\n\r\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u2014think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\r\n\r\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.",

      "description": "King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.\r\n\r\nIn the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.\r\n\r\nEach round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.\r\n\r\nThe Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!\r\n\r\nDuring the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.\r\n\r\nTides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\r\n\r\nThe game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections.\r\n\r\nTaking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five\u2014but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose.

And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?\r\n\r\nThe game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.\r\n\r\nAgricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).\r\nEach player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.\r\nProblem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.\r\nEach player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.",

      "description": "CONTAINS Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion\r\n\r\nIn a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.\r\nNow you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?\r\n\r\nOf course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.\r\n\r\nBuilding happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.\r\n\r\nOnce building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.\r\n\r\nMost of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!\r\n\r\n3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!\r\n\r\nThe Big Expansion includes a number of mix-and-match components:\r\n\r\n- Pieces and rules for five-player games.\r\n- An updated version of Rough Road Ahead, a set of cards previously released in a downloadable format on the Czech Games website that will be expanded and reformatted.\r\n- Additional adventure cards, including two previously available only at Spiel 07.\r\n- A special deck of adventure cards that players individually insert into the deck themselves to surprise their fellow drivers.\r\n- A new alien species.\r\n- New ship building components, including life support for the new ET.\r\n- New ship classes.",

Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice\u2014just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope\u2014if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.\r\n\r\nPrinted on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!\r\n\r\nEach of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.",

Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\r\n\r\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this.

You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.\r\n\r\nAction resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.\r\n\r\nThe Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards \u2014 one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. \u2014 then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose \"no trump\". On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.\r\n\r\nThe playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.\r\n\r\nAfter each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.\r\n\r\nAfter all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.\r\n\r\nA common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.",

If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board.

On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.\r\n\r\nIf a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game.

Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.\r\n\r\nPart of the Catan Series.\r\n\r\nThis game requires The Settlers of Catan. Ideally, using the same publisher and edition of the game.\r\n\r\nCITIES & KNIGHTS\r\nAdds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.\r\n\r\nBelongs to the Catan Series.\r\n\r\nThe game changes the base game in three main ways:\r\n\r\nFirst, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.\r\n\r\nSecond, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)\r\n\r\nFinally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.",

On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.\r\n\r\nSeveral refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game. First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.

And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!\r\n\r\nSushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of \"draft and pass\" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!",

Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.\r\n\r\nPlayers interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells.

      "description": "On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\r\n\r\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\r\n\r\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items \u2014 but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\r\n\r\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\r\n\r\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!",

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s\u00e9ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.\r\n\r\nUnable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.\r\n\r\nIn Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.\r\n\r\nEach hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.\r\n\r\nAfter time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.\r\n\r\nIf one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.\r\n\r\nMediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards \u2014 one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon \u2014 then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.\r\n\r\nIf a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

The current versions of the game date back to the game of Ta-Ka-Radi, which has been played by generations of West African people. It was popularized in the western world in the 1980s. The rules of the game are simple - players take turns trying to move a wood block from the lower areas of the tower to the top of the tower, without causing it to collapse. This becomes progressively more difficult as the tower grows in height. The winner is the last player to successfully move a block to the top of the tower, before it collapses. The excitement, tension, and laughs make this a great game for all ages. Who will cause the tower to collapse?!",

      "description": "Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws.\r\n\r\nChess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.",

      "description": "Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case \u2013 but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!\r\n\r\nThe Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!\r\n\r\nFind out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!\r\n\r\nRoles\r\n\r\nForensic Scientist x1\r\nAs the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder.\u201d When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.\r\n\r\nMurderer x1\r\nWhen the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and the \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d.\r\n\r\nInvestigators x8\r\nTo solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder,\u201d the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.\r\n\r\nAccomplice x1\r\nThe Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.\r\n\r\nWitness x1\r\nThe Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.\r\n\r\nIf the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.",

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!\r\n\r\nKing of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve \"Fame\", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nThe game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.\r\n\r\nThe monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.",

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point\", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.\r\n\r\nThis, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like \"Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a few extra rules. First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists. If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer. If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.",

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nWhere the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base \u2014 all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.\r\n\r\nOne of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.\r\n\r\nThe app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.\r\n\r\nThe use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world\u2019s crises before you know how many troops you\u2019ll need to commit to your base defense.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION: \r\nXCOM: Evolution is an expansion for XCOM: The Board Game that complicates your war effort with new missions, enemies, and invasion plans, as well as mechanics that make your struggles more dangerous than ever. As the alien forces spread and peril increases, the sinister humans of the EXALT seek to take advantage of the chaos to infiltrate and destroy XCOM from within. Their treachery leads to new challenges, and you'll face new crises, you'll find your work subverted, and you'll have to deal with new threats to the very resources you need to win the war.\r\n\r\nFortunately, your team has also made some advances since the war began. The discovery of the mysterious alien substance known as Meld promises to unlock some astonishing breakthroughs in the field of biomechanics. And XCOM: Evolution allows you to pursue some of these advances, potentially bringing formidable new weaponry to the field in the form of MEC Troopers!",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\r\n\r\nThe players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.\r\n\r\nYour basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.\r\n\r\nEach player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:\r\n\r\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\r\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\r\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\r\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\r\n\r\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!\r\n\r\nEXPANSION: HELLAS & ELYSIUM\r\nTerraforming Mars: Hellas & Elysium, the first expansion for Terraforming Mars, consists of a double-sided game board presenting two new areas of Mars:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Elysium takes players almost to the opposite side of Mars' equator, with vast lowlands for oceans in the north and a dry, mineral-rich south. Place a tile on Olympus Mons, the highest peak in the solar system, to gain three free cards!\r\n\r\n\u2022 Hellas, the southern wild, includes Mars' south pole and the enormous seven-hex Hellas crater that just begs to become a giant lake. Building around the pole gives you new placement bonuses in the form of heat and possibly even water.\r\n\r\nEach of these maps consists of new sets of milestones and awards with relevance for that particular map. Place three tiles around the south pole to be a Polar Explorer, for example, or race to have the most estates beside water on Elysium!",

The capitalistic city-state known simply as \u201cThe Factory\u201d, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\r\n\r\nScythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\r\n\r\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u2019s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).\r\n\r\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u2019s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \u201cencounter\u201d cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.\r\n\r\nScythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\r\n\r\nEvery part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.",

      "description": "The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.\r\n\r\nTACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called \"units\" in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).\r\n\r\nThe other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22\" x 28\" mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.\r\n\r\nGame features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.\r\n\r\nTACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera\u00e7\u00e3o MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as \"Tactics III\".",

Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls. A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.\r\n\r\nThe game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun.

Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the roles of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.\r\n\r\nDo you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?",

On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \"orders.\" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.

Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable. Expansions were also released for this system.\r\n\r\n**AGAINST THE OGRE HORDE:**\r\n\r\nMorcar sat motionless on his throne of pure jet, deep in thought. His eyes scanned the image of the Emperor\u2019s lands which he had conjured before him. He had been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute by the Emperor\u2019s accursed Champions. The same fate had befallen his powerful ally, the Witch Lord, whose Army of the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.\r\n\r\nMorcar needed some new and subtle means to attack the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face. A plan had come to him.\r\n\r\nA month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire\u2019s farmlands. This was only the beginning, for as raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.\r\n\r\nKELLAR'S KEEP:\r\n\u201cMy friends, I have alarming news. The Emperor and his army are trapped in Kellar\u2019s Keep, the underground bastion of the fortress of Karak Varn. This great Dwarven stronghold lies deep within the heart of the World\u2019s Edge Mountains. The great book Loretome has revealed a secret passage to me that has been long forgotten. It will be your task to find this passage, known as Grin\u2019s Crag, and bring the Emperor to safety.\r\n\r\nThe fortress is well defended, but I fear that time is against us. The Emperor\u2019s army weakens with starvation while the enemy grows stronger by the day. You must find the four pieces of Grin\u2019s map, that are scattered throughout the halls, if you are to locate the path to Kellar\u2019s Keep. You must not fail, for should you do so, our cause will be lost. It is up to you, brave Heroes, to rescue the Emperor.\u201d",

      "description": "Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.\r\n\r\nPlayers choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.\r\n\r\nPlayers then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nNext comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThere were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).\r\n\r\nThe 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters & Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.\r\n\r\nFinally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being \"collectible\" as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at the Yahoo group Sea of Claws.",

      "description": "By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19\u00d719 (or smaller) grid of intersections. But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones. The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of Go (\u570d\u68cb (w\u00e9i q\u00ed)- \"surrounding game\") appears in the \"Analects\" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17\u00d717 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).",

These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)\r\n\r\nIn the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low.

And in addition to this mammoth campaign game, separate scenarios for each front during each year of the war, which can be combined into two-front scenarios for 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, have been specially designed to allow players to vary the size, difficulty, and playing time of their games.\r\n\r\nFor those who think that World War I Is an unexciting subject for a game, GUNS OF AUGUST will prove a shock comparable to the appearance of British tanks at Cambrai, and German stosstrupen at Caporetto.",

      "slug": "starship-troopers",
      "description": "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:\r\n\r\n\"We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat\u2014his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:\r\n\r\n\"A suit isn't a spacesuit \u2014 although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly\u2014a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.\"\r\n\r\nWith the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as\r\n\r\n\" . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.\"\r\n\r\nIn early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids. In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.\r\n\r\nBut the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:\r\n\r\n\"The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...\"\r\n\r\nAs the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units. Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.\r\n\r\nThe game is set up in a \"Programmed Instruction\" system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. \"Flores died on the way up\") to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.\r\n\r\nWarfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.",

On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process. When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in. After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.\r\n\r\nThe points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan. As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.\r\n\r\nThe last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.",

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire\u2019s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire\u2019s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nImperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You\u2019ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you\u2019ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.\r\n\r\nAs an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.\r\n\r\nWith these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.",

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:\r\n- As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.\r\n- As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.\r\n\r\nFeaturing more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.\r\n\r\nYet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

With over 120 works of art, 40 scenarios cards, and more than 100 unique trait cards, Oceans is the most ambitious project North Star Games has ever tackled.\r\n\r\nTheme\r\nOceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean\u2019s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth\u2019s deepest unexplored region. Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface.\r\n\r\nBut there is more if you are willing to dive deeper...\r\n\r\nOceans also includes a deck of 100 unique power cards called The Deep that represents the unknown. These powerful cards break the seams of the reality you've come to accept, ranging from astonishing things found in the ocean, to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nOceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species. With only 12 Surface traits, it\u2019s easy to wade into your first game without being overwhelmed by new cards. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem. The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability. With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games. These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.\r\n\r\nThe Evolution Series\r\nOceans is a stand-alone game in the Evolution series, but it's a vast departure from other games in the series. The turn structure has been simplified, the game play is much more forgiving, and the web of interconnections has increased dramatically. Whereas Evolution has the feeling of a traditional back-and-forth battle game like Magic: The Gathering, Oceans has the feel of an interactive engine builder where everything is interconnected, and where your engine must continually adapt to a changing environment.",

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\r\n\r\nRoot represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.\r\n\r\nThe Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.\r\n\r\nThe Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.\r\n\r\nIn Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!\r\n\r\n\u2014description from the publisher",

      "description": "Base Game:\r\nHere to Slay is a competitive role-playing fantasy strategy card game that's all about assembling a party of Heroes and slaying monsters (and sometimes sabotaging your friends too) from the creators of Unstable Unicorns.\r\n\r\nIn this game, you\u2019ll assemble a full party of heroes to slay dangerous monsters while working to avoid the sabotage of your foes. The game also includes items you can equip to your heroes, 1V1 challenge cards, and roll modifiers to tip the odds in your favor.\r\n\r\nThe first person to successfully slay three monsters, or build a full party with six classes, wins the game!\r\n\r\nEvery player gets to choose a party leader character to represent them throughout the game. Each party leader card has a class and a skill that gives you an edge over your opponents. Whether you enjoy fighters, bards, wizards, or thieves, you'll find a party leader that's right for your play style - but choose wisely, because you only get one party leader for the whole game!\r\n\r\nYour heroes are brave adventurers, ready to attack monsters and go head to head with your foes! The game includes over 40 unique heroes. Each hero card has a class and an effect, and each hero\u2019s effect has a roll requirement. In order to use a hero\u2019s effect, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that effect\u2019s roll requirement. Heroes take advantage of items, magic and modifiers to increase their chances of making their dice rolls.\r\nIn order to slay that monster, you must roll two dice and score equal to or higher than that monster\u2019s roll requirement.  Be warned: Each monster has a roll range in which they\u2019ll fight back, and if you score within that range, your party might be in grave danger\u2026\r\n\r\nDon't like what your opponent just played? Throw down a challenge! Challenge cards can be played instantly to try to stop another player from playing a hero, item, or magic card. Playing a challenge card initiates a 1V1 challenge in which you and another player both have to roll the dice. If they win the challenge, they still get to play their card, but if you win the challenge, you get to send their card directly to the discard pile!\r\n\r\n\u2014 description from the publisher\r\n\r\nWarriors & Druids:\r\nWarrior and Druid classes join the fray in this Here to Slay expansion.

A new action allows players to add delegates to different parties, the first delegate each generation being free, and additional ones costing 5 MC. Neutral delegates are added by the global events, representing the wishes and trends of society.\r\nWhen a player (even the neutral player) has more delegates in a party than any other player, that player takes over the party leader seat for that party, and when a party has more delegates than any other party, it becomes dominant. The dominant party will become ruling during the next generation, imposing its one-time bonus, its ongoing policy, and granting chairmanship for its party leader, awarding that player 1 terraform rating.\r\n\r\nParty: Bonus: Policy:\r\nKelvinist 1MC/heat production 10MC -> 1 heat production + 1 energy production\r\nScientist 1MC/science tag 10MC -> draw 3 cards (once per player)\r\nUnity 1MC/planet tag Titanium is worth +1MC\r\nMars First 1MC/building tag Placing a tile on Mars gives 1 steel\r\nGreens 1MC/biological tag placing a greenery tile gives 4MC\r\nReds 1TR for the lowest player Increasing TR in the action phase costs +3MC\r\n\r\nThe political arena also determines the players' influence, which can be used to moderate or enhance the effect of the current global event. Influence is gained from being the chairman of the Committee, being party leader in the dominant party, and for having a non-leader delegate in the dominant party.\r\nIn order to pay for all these new bonuses, the Committee is revising the terraform rating, lowering it for all players by 1 step each generation.\r\n\r\nIn Turmoil, players can try to force their own agenda, or push it in a more moderate, economic way. They can play to mitigate the global events with influence, or adjust their play to better take advantage of them. And they can anticipate the competing players' agendas and try to benefit from them, or counteract them.\r\n\r\nTurmoil is an expert expansion - be prepared to meet the full spectrum of human civilization in the era of terraforming Mars!\r\n\r\n\u2014description from publisher",

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\r\n\r\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player.

When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\r\n\r\nLeadership: Be the leader \u2014 i.e., have more clan figures than any other player \u2014 of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.\r\nLand: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\r\nReligion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\r\nOver the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.\r\n\r\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\r\n\r\nWhile Inis has \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.",

Forbidden by law from declaring open war, their secret wars allow for more subtle weapons: seduction, espionage and assassination.\r\n\r\nWith this game, you and your friends can tell stories of nobles engaged in these covert conflicts.

And all are seeking their Happily Ever After.\r\n\r\nFairy tales and folktales have served as fertile ground for many stories, novels, cartoons, movies, and games. They speak to common - possibly timeless - human emotional concerns. Despite being retold again and again until they are cliche and their images instantly familiar, something about fairytales always remains fresh and new, speaking expressively to even long-familiar readers or hearers. Fairytales unite the ordinary and the extraordinary in stories full of magic, wonder, and moral lessons.\r\n\r\nThe Zorcerer of Zo (ZoZ) is a fairytale RPG by Atomic Sock Monkey Press, publishers of Dead Inside and Truth & Justice. Inside ZoZ, you'll find:\r\n\r\n- An extensive discussion on fairytales, their nature and tropes.\r\n- An evocative game setting: the Zantabulous Land of Zo (and its five Kingdoms) -- strongly influenced by much-beloved fairytale otherworlds like Oz (naturally), Narnia, Wonderland, Fantastica, The Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Florin & Guilder, Neverland, Living Island -- and how it developed in-play with the help of the author's gaming group.\r\n- The \"Good Parts\" PDQ System -- a slimmed-down version of the PDQ Core Rules, complete in itself, suitable for fast-paced, straightforward fairytale play.\r\n- Extensive notes on how the initial ZoZ campaign was begun, the setting and episodes were developed, how the game was run, and the campaign came to an exciting climax (and advice on how you can do the same yourself).\r\n- Two \"DVD commentary tracks\" of textboxes -- one from the author/GM and one from the players of the PCs -- on the Actual Play of the campaign.\r\n- An appendix with Bonus Material like campaign production notes and additional NPCs.",

      "description": "Burning Wheel is an award-winning fantasy roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of vibrant, dynamic characters whose very beliefs propel the story forward. Starting with a simple D6 dice pool mechanic, this game intuitively builds on its core concepts. The rules detail dramatic systems for task resolution, advancement, trials of belief, tests of nerve, searing social conflict, dangerous sorcery, miraculous faith, and brutal, gut-wrenching martial combat.  Behind the dice, your decisions drive the game's systems. Their choices tangibly affect every outcome-from glorious victory to ignominious defeat. But there are consequences to every decision, ramifications to every action. The choices you make close off one path, while opening another. This philosophy underpins the character creation system for Burning Wheel. And it's not just a matter of pushing a point here, or nudging a number there: As soon as a player decides to make a character in Burning Wheel, he is confronted with decisions about the character's past, ethics, beliefs, scars, goals and dreams. Questions whose answers affect not only the player's character, but the shape of the story as a whole. Burning Wheel is presented in an easy-to-read writing style, with plenty of insight and advice from the designer. If you're not careful, Burning Wheel will change the way you play roleplaying games. The Gold Edition combines both the Revised Edition's Burning Wheel and Character Burner. It has been reorganized for clarity and updated by the author.",

Despite the ecopocalypse and social upheavals on Earth, humanity has conquered the solar system and partially terraformed Mars. Advancements in biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science have transformed our lives. Everyone is wirelessly networked with the world around them, AIs process vast amounts of information, and nano-fabrication enables people to \"print\" complex devices from the molecular level - at home. Biotechnology allows people to genefix, enhance, and clone their bodies, while others pursue body modifications to adapt to new environments or make themselves into something no longer quite human. People\u2019s minds and memories can be digitized, uploaded, transferred over long distances, and downloaded into new bodies (biological or synthetic). Death has been defeated - for those who can afford it.\r\n\r\nFrom within, disaster struck. Transhumanity reaped the rewards of its arrogance when conflict spiked between the battered nations of Earth, already weakened by decades of climate catastrophes and other disruptive factors. Rampant netwars soon exploded into physical conflicts with spiraling body counts. In the midst of these aggressions, a group of military AIs known as TITANS quietly achieved full sentience and autonomy, and rapidly began exponentially incrementing their own intellectual growth. The AI intelligences spawned by this hard-takeoff singularity quickly turned against transhumanity, enveloping the system in unprecedented levels of violence, disaster, and warfare. What began as a whirlwind of conflict between political factions, revolutionaries, and hypercorps soon escalated into a struggle between man and machine.\r\n\r\nIn just a few years, transhumanity was nearly wiped out with nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, destructive nanoswarms, infowar attacks, mass uploads, and other unexplained singularity events, ripping the superpowers of old to pieces. Our planetary home \"Earth\" was transformed into a toxic and strange hellhole, while many major habitats were left frozen sarcophagi in the vacuum of space. Just as quickly as they came, the TITANS disappeared, taking millions of uploaded minds with them, leaving behind a network of wormhole gateways. Known as Pandora Gates, these poorly-understood devices allow instantaneous teleportation to distant star systems - often one-way and/or fatal. Though only a handful of Pandora Gates are known to exist - each highly contested - the foolish, brave, curious, and desperate are already risking certain death to enter and explore what lies beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the Fall, transhumanity lives on, divided into a patchwork of hypercorp combines, survivalist stations, transhuman faction species, and city-state habitats. Under the oppressive police states of immortal inner-system oligarchies, advanced technologies remain highly restricted, and refugee infomorphs are held in virtual slavery or resleeved in robotic bodies and forced into indentured labor. In the outer system, rebel transhuman scientists and techno-anarchists struggle to maintain a new society - from each according to their imagination and to each according to their need. And on the fringes and in the niches lurk networked tribes of political extremists, religious fanatics, criminal entrepeneurs, and bizarre posthumans, among other, stranger, and more alien things ...\r\n\r\nThough most claim the Fall was carefully orchestrated by the out-of-control TITANS, others whisper that the driving powers behind the wars - both AI and transhuman - were infected by a mutating virus with multiple infection vectors - biological, information, nano - dubbed the Exsurgent virus. Whatever its source, this virus has been known to sometimes transform its victims into something unexplainable ... something monstrous and reality-altering. Whatever the truth, the remnants of the TITANS and this virus were left to the desolated ruins or driven to the edges of the system, where they remain hidden away in dark corners, quietly waiting to infect the minds of the scavengers and explorers who find them ...\r\n\r\n**System**\r\n\r\nEclipse Phase uses a variant d100/percentile system with some twists. The game is fast and simple, streamlined so players can dive into the world and action without being burdened down by complex rules.",

Sheets are left unfolded and mantelpieces undusted when giant robots crash through the mansion, ninjas attack and kidnap the young master, and a demonic pit to Hell opens up in the pantry... and all before teatime!\r\n\r\nPlay in the modern comedy setting, or mix it up with 9 additional settings including Victorian era, old Edo period, fantasy and post-apocalypse; and 6 genres including romance, horror, and action. Due to the rules system and random events that form the backbone of the Maid RPG, the game practically runs itself: Go from opening the book to playing a game with friends within just minutes!\r\n\r\n- Three game styles in one: The traditional scenario-type; the random event-driven type; and the \"favor race\", a race to the master's heart!\r\n- Make characters and start playing the game within minutes of opening the book. Everything about the game gears it for Fast Play, Now.\r\n- Optional character types including player-character masters and butlers, and optional rules for seduction and romantic tragedy.\r\n- 11 complete adventure scenarios.\r\n- 3 complete \"replays\", actual play scenarios in screenplay format. Great for learning the feel of the game.\r\n- The first ever Japanese tabletop role-playing game to be released in English! ...which, when you think about it, totally makes sense in a weird sort of way.\r\n- Hundreds of optional items, costumes, genre and setting events, all presented in a way to easily bring them into the game!\r\n- Combines the original Japanese core book and two supplements into one huge, complete edition of the game in English.

      "description": "Torchbearer is a riff on the early model of fantasy role-playing games. In it, you take on the role of an adventurer seeking his or her fortune. To earn that fortune, you must explore forlorn ruins, brave terrible monsters and retrieve forgotten treasures. However, this game is not about being a hero. It is not about fighting for what you believe. This game is about exploration and survival. You may become a hero. You might have to fight for your ideals. But to do either of those things, you must prove yourself in the wilds. Because there are no jobs, no inheritance, no other opportunities for our deadbeat adventurers. This life is their only hope to prosper in this world.\r\n\r\n*Torchbearer*  is part of the brand of games Burning Wheel HQ has been producing for over ten years. So like all of our other games, this is a game about making difficult choices while exploring the world and your character through the game rules and systems. And like all of our games, the heart of the experience is about how your character changes when faced with adversity.\r\n\r\nThis is a hard game, not a simple one. There are many moving parts and it\u2019s not possible to experience the whole game in one or even two sessions. But if you\u2019re ready to sink your teeth into a good game that will reward you for mastering the system over 10 or 20 sessions, this is the game for you.",

      "description": "ARC powers lean and tightly-paced stories. The unique blend of real-time and in-story mechanics means that games feel urgent and high-stakes.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, you overcome challenges by rolling a six-sided die after setting a Threshold Number determined by your hero's capabilities, problem-solving approach, and the difficulty of the task. Roll under means success, over fails, and an equal roll generates even more complications.\r\n\r\nThe rest of ARC's system is overclocked to spark stories that slay.\r\n\r\n- Actions come with consequences. ARC explicitly guides players to roll only when there's real stakes involved. In many situations, it's entirely possible to fail intentionally to reap opportunities, or accept success with tangible consequences.\r\n- Celebrate ingenuity. Heroes are naturally adept at their skills, but players articulate how these are applied: whether creatively, carefully, or in a concerted manner. Insightful solutions can ease the Threshold Number.\r\n- A new approach to spellcasting. Cast spells & techniques with different power levels, but take care: replenishing these will require a strange ritual. Burning a memento, sleeping all day, even eating a door.\r\n\r\n...and spark groups that just want to play.\r\n\r\n- Any fantasy story, any setting. ARC is not tied to a setting and can be adapted to your favorite world\u2014even your own unique creation.\r\n- Manage your hours. The Doomsday Clock allows you to dictate literally how much time you need for your story.\r\n- Scaffolding to sustain dynamics and agency. Session zero prompts to set collective expectations; clear focus on cultivating shared stakes; and structure + guidance to ensure story arcs breathe, live, and respond meaningfully to player action.\r\n\r\nBeyond rules, ARC is written to enable anyone\u2014newcomer and veteran alike\u2014to build world-saving stories together. The end may be coming, but that doesn't mean you can't be a new adventurer.\r\n\r\nDoom is the centerpiece and the enemy\u2014and running out of time unleashes it on the world. But while it's a turn for the worse, it is not a fail state. Instead, it can even provide the foundation for the next exciting chapter...\r\n\r\nAdd in bonus content in the form of 50+ items, 40 spells & techniques and 36 unusual creatures, from bunny-eared noblins to moon-eating wyrms, and you have plenty of (optional) flavor for stories as vivid and strange as ARC's art.",

      "description": "Niki Segnit was inspired to write The Flavour Thesaurus when she noticed how dependent she was on recipes. As she says- 'Following the instructions in a recipe is like parroting pre-formed sentences from a phrasebook. Forming an understanding of how flavours work together, on the other hand, is like learning the language; it allows you to express yourself freely, to improvise, to find appropriate substitutions for ingredients, to cook a dish the way you fancy cooking it.' What Niki felt she needed was a manual, a primer to help her understand how and why one flavour might go with another, their points in common and their differences - something, in fact, like a thesaurus of flavours. But no such book existed, so she decided to put one together herself.\r\n\r\nThe result is a compendium of flavour pairings which offers endless diversion and inspiration. In this lively, easy to follow and exceptionally enjoyable book, Niki Segnit takes 99 popular ingredients and explores the ways they might be combined in the kitchen. She has scoured thousands of recipes in countless recipe books, talked to dozens of food technologists and chefs, and eaten in many restaurants - all in her quest for flavour pairings. The book follows the form of Roget's Thesaurus. The back section lists the ingredients alphabetically, and suggests classic and less well known flavour matches for each. The front section contains an entry for every flavour match listed in the back section and is organised into 16 flavour themes such as Bramble + Hedge, Green + Grassy, and Earthy. There are 980 entries in all.\r\n\r\nIt examines classic pairings such as pork + apple, lamb + apricot, and cucumber + dill; contemporary favourites like chocolate & chilli, lobster + vanilla, and goat's cheese + beetroot; and interesting but unlikely-sounding couples including black pudding + chocolate, lemon + beef, blueberry + mushroom, and watermelon + oyster.",

At street level, you're outsiders to the secret world of magick, ordinary people entering a land of mystery and peril.

Background material is divided up as well, so new players in a street-level campaign only read what the GM wants them to know.\r\n\r\nBut the beats don't stop there:\r\n\r\n- Much more information for new players, to get them into the mindset of the game and help them make better characters and stronger campaigns.\r\n- New character-creation options, including Trigger Events, Paradigm Skills, and power levels scaled to match the level of campaign you're playing.\r\n- Numerous rules tweaks, including a new initiative system, Fuzzy Logic skill checks, player-directed combat modifiers, amped-up martial arts rules, a new experience system, and more, all dedicated to upgrading UA's innovative percentile system into a lean and precise tool for fast play and player empowerment.\r\n- More magick for non-adepts: Authentic Thaumaturgy, new rituals and artifacts, and revised versions of Proxy Magick and Tilts allow the freewheeling use of symbolic, sympathetic magick by anyone with the will to make it happen.\r\n- Twelve schools of magick (up from seven in UA1) for obsessed adepts, including revised versions of published schools (Bibliomancy, Personamancy, and Urbanomancy) and two new schools (Videomancy and Narcotic Alchemy).\r\n- Fourteen avatars (up from eight in UA1) for archetypalists, including revised versions of published avatars (The Messenger, The Mother, The Mystic Hermaphrodite, and the True King) and two new avatars (The MVP and The Warrior).\r\n- More resources for the GM, including specific guidance on combat, wounds, skill checks, campaign building, and other critical issues.\r\n- New cover art and design, new interior art and design, and a hardcover binding to keep this fat bastard of a game in line.",

Traces of their cyclopean cities can still be found on remote islands, buried amid the shifting desert sands, and in the frozen wastes of the polar extremes. Originally they came to this world from the stars. They sleep now, some deep within the earth or beneath the sea. When the stars are right they shall again walk the earth.\r\n\r\nCall of Cthulhu is a tabletop roleplaying game based upon the worlds of H. P. Lovecraft. It is a game of secrets, mysteries, and horror. Playing the role of steadfast investigators, you travel to strange and dangerous places, uncover foul plots, and stand against the terrors of the Cthulhu Mythos. You encounter sanity-blasting entities, monsters, and insane cultists. Within strange and forgotten tomes of lore you discover revelations that man was not meant to know. You and your companions may very well decide the fate of the world.\r\n\r\nThis book, the Keeper Rulebook, contains the core rules, background, guidance, spells, and monsters of the game. It is intended for use by the Keeper of Arcane Lore (the Keeper) \u2014 that player who will present the adventure to the other players. You must have at least one copy of this book to play Call of Cthulhu. The other players, the Investigators, should have one or more copies of the Investigator Handbook, containing expanded rules for character creation, skills, occupations, equipment, and more.\r\n\r\nCall of Cthulhu, 7th edition, is backwards-compatible with all other available Chaosium titles.",

Maybe you and your girlfriend figured you could scare your wife into a divorce, but things went pear-shaped and now a gang of cranked-up Mexicans with latex gloves and a pit bull are looking for you.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like such a good idea at the time.\r\n\r\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong - inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You'll play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. There will be big dreams and flawed execution. It won't go well for them, to put it mildly, and in the end it will probably all go south in a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination. It's designed to be played in a single session, usually around two and a half hours, with no prep.\r\n\r\n**From the Designer:**\r\n\r\nFiasco is a GM-less game for 3-5 players, designed to be played in a few hours with six-sided dice and no preparation. During a game you will engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It's like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it'd take to watch one.\r\n\r\nA game of Fiasco begins with The Setup -- a group activity where you and your friends create a potent and unstable set of circumstances. You choose a Playset, which fixes the game in a particular time and place -- a contemporary southern town, maybe, or the old west. Using a pile of dice, you create an interconnected circle of Relationships and Details pulled from the Playset. Once you\u2019ve created a situation poised on the brink of juicy disaster, you define characters based on your choices. Once the Setup is done, you play out scenes, which focus on various characters in rotation.",

Want to explore an epic history of your own creation, hundreds or thousands of years long, all in an afternoon? That's Microscope.\r\n\r\nYou won't play the game in chronological order. You can defy the limits of time and space, jumping backward or forward to explore the parts of the history that interest you. Want to leap a thousand years into the future and see how an institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal in Microscope.\r\n\r\nYou have vast power to create... and to destroy. Build beautiful, tranquil jewels of civilization and then consume them with nuclear fire. Zoom out to watch the majestic tide of history wash across empires, then zoom in and explore the lives of the people who endured it.\r\n\r\n- Mock chronological order.\r\n\r\n- Defy time and space.\r\n\r\n- Build worlds and destroy them.\r\n\r\n**A role-playing game for two to four players.

It generally encourages narrativist play.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in \"a West that never quite was\" - loosely based on the Mormon State of Deseret in pre-statehood Utah. Players are \"God's Watchdogs\" (Dogs), who travel from town to town delivering mail, helping out the community and enforcing the judgments of the True Faith of the King of Life. This may involve anything from delivering new interpretations to the town's Steward to executing heretics. Dogs have absolute authority within the Faith, but not within the laws of the Territorial Authority, and so their actions can lead to conflict with the government in the East.",

And despite this wide range of genres we tried out and experimented with, the system never lost its flavour. The Awesome System is not a generic system. It\u2019s a rules set that can be used for any setting you could ever dream of, but it possesses immense flavour, charisma, wit and grace hard-coded into the very rules themselves. In the Awesome System, having a fun game is inescapable.\r\n\r\nWant to understand it a bit better? Think of any movie starring Bruce Campbell or Jackie Chan, or Sylvester Stallone. That feeling of fun, adventure and excitement you get from those movies is what we\u2019ve captured here in one of the simplest, easiest to use rules sets you\u2019ll ever play with. It ensures you can make the kind of character you want to make, rather than your personality being dictated by the rules or, worse, your class role, but thanks to the Stunt System and the clever new combat system we\u2019ve included, you can still have fun when getting into the crunchier aspects of the game, regardless of whether your character is optimized for it or not.\r\n\r\nSo what\u2019re you waiting for?

Familiar mechanics are employed to forge new worlds and explore new possibilities, guidelines built on long experience used to help a group venture in wholly new directions. Within the full-color pages of Stars Without Number: Revised Edition, you'll find\u2026 .\r\n\r\n- **Backwards compatibility**, as the Revised Edition is built to work cleanly with existing Stars Without Number supplements and materials. The new systems slot in smoothly, and you can take or leave them individually as your group prefers.\r\n\r\n- **Expanded character creation**, with PCs now customized by special talents and character foci, new options for psychic characters, and new ways to make your hero mechanically distinct. Yet the process is still smooth and quick, with a special quick generator spread to create a hero from nothing more than a half-dozen die rolls.\r\n\r\n- **Refined psionics**, with more options to distinguish your psychic hero's powers and more flexible choices for their abilities. Tailor your psychic to your concept, whether as a cynical gunslinging brainguard or an ascetic psychic healer from a world of austere psionic scholars.\r\n\r\n- **Improved starship combat**, with decisive roles for every member of the party. Build your own starships with the included system and employ new hardware and new starship mods to make your ungainly crate the fastest contraband runner this side of the Veil Nebula.\r\n\r\n- **New systems** to support additional types of play, including rules for hacking, remote drones, and expert technical modification of gear and starships.\r\n\r\n- **Upgraded tools for sandbox sector creation**, with forty new world tags to help define a GM's stellar creations, guides for adding additional system points of interest, and material to help a GM define the interesting traits of the worlds they create. These tools aren't just a clump of random tables, they're a framework to boost your own creativity and help you make fast, good, playable material for your game.\r\n\r\n- **Augmented adventure creation guidelines.** Aside from a hundred piping-hot adventure seeds that mesh smoothly with the world creation tools, Stars Without Number: Revised Edition also includes content to help you turn your vague ideas into a playable evening's adventure. Guidelines on challenges, rewards, and complications in play are all aimed toward the working GM, the man or woman who's not just theorizing their adventures, but actually responsible for making something fun for the whole group.\r\n\r\n- **Tools for creating aliens, Virtual Intelligences, and hostile human foes**, with guidelines for handling potentially-hostile encounters and creating the kind of fearsome xenobeasts that can challenge the doughtiest explorer. Or perhaps you want to be an alien or robot? You'll find the tools for that in Stars Without Number: Revised Edition.\r\n\r\n- **Faction rules**, for handling the background warring and intrigues of hostile groups. Need to add life and motion to your stellar sectors? Sprinkle in a few factions to make news for the PCs to respond to, or use these rules to handle the colonies, spy agencies, mercenary companies, or other enterprises your heroes establish.\r\n\r\nAnd these things? They're all in the free version. Yes, just like the original edition, Stars Without Number: Revised Edition has a free PDF edition to share with your friends and pass around to interested parties. Those daring stellar freebooters who purchase this deluxe version will get...\r\n\r\n- **Transhuman tech**, with rules for bodyswapping, digital identities, post-scarcity economics, and just as importantly, GM guidelines on making exciting adventures when all the old pillars of familiarity have fallen away.\r\n\r\n- **True AIs**, the vast and terrible intellects that can bring forth wonders and ruin in equal measure.

The game took players away from traditional elements of RPGs and vampiric lore and into a modern 1990s view of style and performance which was much darker and bleaker than before.\r\n\r\nIt was designed on a Storyteller system using the dice pool as a main mechanism. The success of this original game lead to a series of similar horror games covering Werewolves, Mummies, Demons and other horror favourites. The White Wolf games led the way in story centred gaming and the move from dice rolling to role playing. It also encouraged RPGs to try the newly developing Live Action Role Playing (Larp) scene (it being easier to dress up as a Goth Vamp than an Elf.)",

But some very rare men over the course of history duplicated the story of myth, by bringing life to a dead body. Life, fueled by Pyros, but without a soul, without humanity. Those men are now long dead, the ones who are known to have mastered this art. But their creations live on. And reproduce.\r\n\r\nPromethean is a game set in the World of Darkness, a contemporary world like ours but with deeper shadows, where the worst sort of urban legends, occult mysteries and conspiracy theories are usually true. As such, contemporary issues such as science are not treated as science fiction, with technologies like robots and spaceships that don't exist yet, or mad scientists creating false life in sterile laboratories. Instead, these issues are seen in the half-light of ancient mysticism and magic. The force that animates Prometheans is not made of nanotech; it's a mysterious energy spoken of in ancient myth: the Divine Fire of the gods. The beings who make monsters aren't scientists trying to prove their crackpot theories - they're other monsters seeking to assuage their loneliness or to hand off their curse so they can escape it themselves.\r\n\r\nIn short, Promethean is a modern horror game, tinged with elements from medieval alchemy, ancient myth, and modern occultism. It's a game about monsters who want to be human. Despite their strength, endurance, and amazing powers, they envy mortals, for as weak, petty and ignorant as we mortals can be, we have something Prometheans don't: We have each other.",

Only rarely do our experiences draw back the veil of shadows and reveal the horror in our midst. These glimpses into the supernatural can cause us to retreat into comforting lies - 'There are no such things as monsters' - or stir our morbid curiosity. Only a few, however, can overcome their fear and dare to look deeper.\r\n\r\n**Abandon Hope All Who Enter**\r\n\r\nThe World of Darkness Rulebook introduces a version of our contemporary world where the supernatural is real. Players join to tell tales of mystery and horror, where theme, mood and plot are more important to a character\u2019s experiences than his weapons or equipment. Inside are rules for character creation, task resolution, combat and any activity your character attempts as he delves into the shadows.\r\n\r\nThis is the core rulebook for the new World Of Darkness (WoD) RPG from White Wolf Game Studio published in 2004. This rules set unifies the Storytelling system. In order to play the new WoD games, you need this core rules book and, if you wish, the Supplement for the setting you want to play, such as Vampire: The Requiem, which contains rules specific to that setting.",

Bushido\u2019s staunch and unyielding code of conduct binds samurai to duty, strengthening their character and defining their choices. While some samurai serve the greater good, others use the strictures of Bushido to manipulate the lower ranks and advance their own power. Will you follow honor or reject it? The choice is yours!\r\n\r\nEight Great Clans form the heart of Rokugan\u2019s culture. Each is defined by its own principles, values, and agendas. Each sees the Code of Bushido in its own way. Each seeks to serve the Emperor with its own unique talents. Take up the soul of your ancestors \u2014 the samurai\u2019s daisho \u2014 and fight for the glory and honor of your family and Clan. Now is the time for heroes, in a world where Honor is a force more powerful than Steel.\r\n\r\nLegend of the Five Rings Fourth Edition overhauls the classic Roll-and-Keep system, bringing the mechanical intricacy of 3rd with the rich flavor of 1st Edition. The rules for things such as dueling, spells, and court have been streamlined. The Great Clans have been brought back to their core identities, the Crab are the Crab, the Crane are the Crane, and everything that exemplifies them. Unlike previous editions, Fourth Edition is not tied to a particular timeline in the Emerald Empire. It is more of a toolset that can be used at any time period in the rich history of the game. This will allow GMs and players to tell their own story, whether it follows L5R canon or goes off on its own epic tale!",

You didn\u2019t come in from the cold. Instead, you found your own entrances into Europe\u2019s clandestine networks of power and crime.\r\n\r\nYou did a few ops, and you asked even fewer questions. Who gave you that job in Prague? Who paid for your silence in that Swiss account? You told yourself it didn\u2019t matter.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to matter a lot. Because it turned out you were working for vampires.\r\n\r\nVampires exist. What can they do? Who do they own? Where is safe?\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t know those answers yet. So you\u2019d better start asking questions. You have to trace the bloodsuckers\u2019 operations, penetrate their networks, follow their trail, and target their weak points. Because if you don\u2019t hunt them, they will hunt you.\r\n\r\nAnd they will kill you.\r\n\r\nOr worse.\r\n\r\nNight\u2019s Black Agents brings the GUMSHOE engine to the spy thriller genre, combining the propulsive paranoia of movies like Ronin and The Bourne Identity with supernatural horror straight out of Bram Stoker. Investigation is crucial, but it never slows down the action, which explodes with expanded options for bone-crunching combat, high-tech tradecraft, and adrenaline-fueled chases.\r\n\r\nUpdating classic Gothic terrors for the postmodern age, Night\u2019s Black Agents presents thoroughly modular monstrosity: GMs can build their own vampires, mashup their own minions, kitbash their own conspiracies to suit their personal sense of style and story. Rules options let you set the level of betrayal, grit, and action in your game. Riff from the worked examples or mix and match vampiric abilities, agendas, and assets for a completely custom sanguinary spy saga.\r\n\r\nThe included hook adventure gets the campaign going; the included city setting shows you what might be clotting in Marseilles\u2019 veins even now.

      "description": "In Nomine is a role-playing game designed by Derek Pearcy and published in 1997 by Steve Jackson Games, based on the French game In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas. Players typically assume the role of angels and demons in a setting that draws heavily on the traditional Christian mythos. In Nomine won the Origins Award for Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1997.\r\n\r\nThis system uses three six sided dice, one of which is different and known as the \"Check Digit.\" Two dice are added together and compared against a target number, where equal to or lower than that target number is a success. The Check Digit is used to determine the degree of success from 1-6. Rolling 111 and 666 have special meaning (known as 'divine intervention'). In the case of 111, it means God has intervened (1+1+1=3, the Trinity). In the case of 666, Lucifer has intervened (666 = Number of the Beast). This may be a critical success or critical fumble, depending on what side of the Celestial conflict one is on.",

Almost any situation which occurs in any SF novel, movie, or short story can be recreated in Traveller with a little work on the part of the referee.\r\n\r\nIn Traveller, mankind has conquered the stars, and travels from one stellar system to another as easily as present day Terrans can travel from one continent to another. The tremendous distances involved, however, dictate that interstellar voyages can take weeks, months, and sometimes even years. A situation similar to earth in the eighteenth century is created, where communication is limited to the speed of travel, and the stage is set for adventure in a grand fashion, with all the trappings of the classic space opera: giant, star-spanning empires (good, evil, or both), huge starfleets, wily interstellar merchants (or pirates, depending upon your point of view), complex diplomatic maneuvers, larger than life heroes, heroines, and villains the mind boggles.",

      "description": "Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political manoeuvring, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\r\n\r\n\r\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbour's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.",

As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\r\n\r\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\r\n\r\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\r\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\r\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\r\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\r\n5) Loan - Take a \u00a330 loan and reduce your income.\r\n\r\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\r\n\r\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card.

The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.\r\n\r\nThe game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship.

To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.\r\n\r\nThe humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.",

They illuminate only tiles directly connected to their own, and when players move, tiles that fall into darkness are removed from the game. Doubling back the way you came only opens new paths, the old ones being lost forever with critical keys and gates vanishing if your light move away from them...",
