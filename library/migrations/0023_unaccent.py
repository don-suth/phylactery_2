        For this migration to work - the database-user the app uses needs to have
        superuser permissions.
        
        This is done by executing the following SQL:
            ALTER ROLE <username> SUPERUSER;
        It is recommended that you revoke superuser permissions afterwards:
            ALTER ROLE <username> NOSUPERUSER;
