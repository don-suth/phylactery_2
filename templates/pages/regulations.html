                The responsible gatekeeper is neither obligated to award a consumable (for instance, in the case of the bin being emptied when it was already nearly empty,) nor barred from awarding themselves or other gatekeepers consumables - though in such a case they still have to have actually emptied the bin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Members shall not be eligible to claim a free consumable if they have already received a reward for the same instance of that action from another club.

                    Unigames has many different types of resources, each with their own rules and restrictions on how they can be borrowed and for how long. These are listed below.

                        In the case that Cameron Hall is both too busy and unsuitable to hold an intended game or event, they may be long-term borrowed provided that they don't leave the UWA campus and for no more than 24 hours.
