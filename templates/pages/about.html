	<h1>Unigames</h1>
	<h2>What is Unigames?</h2>
	<p>
		Unigames is UWA's traditional gaming club. 
		That means that all types of non-video gaming 
		(including tabletop RPGs, board games, wargames, card games, and more!) 
		are covered under our umbrella.
	
		The club was formed in 1983, when two previous UWA clubs - the Wargaming club 
		and the Simulations Society - merged to form one club.
	
		Since then, Unigames has only grown stronger. 
		We pride ourselves on our inclusive and passionate member base,
		as well as our huge library that contains (almost) any game you could want to play!
	</p>
	
	<h2>What can I do at Unigames?</h2>
	<p>
		Play games! There are many roleplaying campaigns in action at the moment, held either weekly or fortnightly.
		Popular roleplaying systems at the moment include D&D (5th, 4th and Pathfinder are most common), Dark Heresy
		(and family), nWoD, and Ad Eva 3.5 (giant robots!).
		For the non-roleplayers, if you pick the right moment it's usually possible to tap the boundless energy of
		Unigames hordes for Dominion, Settlers of Catan, Munchkin, Dead of Winter, X-COM or any of our other dozens of
		boardgames. But if you get addicted, you may want to consider the statutory withdrawal dates for some or all of
		your units! It's a case of choosing your poison - the Unigames library has a plethora of weird and wonderful
		games in stock, some of which are used all the time, and some of which haven't been dusted off in a decade. Who
		knows what you could find.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Where is the Unigames clubroom?</h2>
	<p>
		For a start, Unigames is located above the UWA (35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley) Tavern. If you don't know where that
		is, just ask anyone you can find, wandering anywhere on campus. From standing in front of the Tavern, facing the
		Tavern, walk left and follow the Tavern's fence around the corner. Keep wandering around this wall of the Tavern
		until you hit an inset in the wall. The door facing away from the river is the entrance to all the higher parts
		of Cameron Hall. If that doesn't help, you can also follow <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BTEKh21mA">this handy video</a> from our 2018 President Gavin.
	</p><p>
	Once you've found the entrance to Cameron Hall, follow the stairs up to the second floor (i.e. two stories up), walk
	past whatever club currently inhabits the first room, take the big doors and go straight ahead. Ignore the glass
	doors to your right, and keep walking. Enter the first corridor on your right, and Unigames will be the club
	directly in front of you.
</p>
	
	<h2>When is Unigames open?</h2>
	<p>
		Whenever you can grab one of the gatekeepers by the arm and make them unlock the cabinet/clubroom, which is more
		or less whenever you want it to be. We are blessed with gatekeepers who have made Cameron Hall, the location of
		the Unigames clubroom, their surrogate home, and it's unlikely one of them won't be around at virtually any time
		you're likely to be. Of course, if you do hang around more than they do (and run campaigns) you can apply for
		gate - just ask a committee member or gatekeeper for the form.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What discounts do I get?</h2>
	<p>
		One of the benefits of Unigames membership is a 10% discount on all materials at Tactics, Perth's premier gaming
		supply store. Just show your membership card when you go to pay for things.
